          <p>
            Go Bucharest was born from the frustration of planning memorable nights out. 
            As students with limited budgets, we struggled to find reliable information 
            about venues, events, and prices in our vibrant city.
          </p>
          <p>
            What started as a simple spreadsheet of our favorite spots evolved into 
            this platform that now helps thousands discover Bucharest's nightlife. 
            We analyze venues, curate events, and provide transparent pricing so 
            you can focus on creating unforgettable memories.
